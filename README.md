These are my learnings froma attempting to learn Machine Learning .. 'badamTsss'


Classifier - we Train this to identify params for us.

Types:
  Artificial Neural Networks
  Support Vector Machine
  Decision Trees

Features  - usually these are attributes describing an item e.g apple: red, smooth, 110gs

Lables - Outputs we want from our classified data

Iris.pdf is an example of how a decision tree goes through data

**  FEATURES **
Classifiers only work as good as the Features you collect
1. Collect more than one set of features
2. Use thought experiments to try and classify the data using the collected features
3. Avoid Using Useless features
4. Use independent features only
5. Remove Highly correlated features
6. Use features that are easy to understand

Ideal Features are. ...
